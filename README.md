SQL Scripts:
SQL queries for data extraction, cleaning, and analysis. Each query is well-documented with comments to explain its purpose.
Datasets:
Includes anonymized or sample datasets used in this analysis.
Documentation:
Detailed methodology and findings of the project, including insights and key takeaways.
Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bike-sharing data to uncover trends, identify key patterns, and provide actionable insights for operational efficiency.

Key Objectives:
Analyze bike collection frequency at stations to determine resource allocation.
Identify peak hours and underutilized stations.
Provide visual summaries of station activity for stakeholders.
Key Insights
Busiest Stations: SQL queries revealed the top 5 stations with the highest bike collection frequency, helping optimize bike redistribution.
Peak Hours Analysis: Identified timeframes with the highest bike usage to improve station readiness.
Underutilized Stations: Highlighted areas with lower usage rates, offering opportunities for improvement or resource reallocation.
Tools and Skills Used
SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and trend analysis.
SAS: Used for preprocessing and further statistical analysis of the dataset.
Visualization Tools: Bar charts and other visual summaries were created using Excel and Power BI.
Visualizations
Busiest Stations Chart: Displays bike collection frequency for each station.
Peak Hour Analysis: Graphical representation of usage trends during different times of the day.
Files available in the /Visualizations folder.
SQL Scripts
Scripts Available:
Data Cleaning (data_cleaning.sql): Removes duplicates, fills missing values, and prepares data for analysis.
Busiest Stations (busiest_stations.sql): Identifies the top stations based on bike collection frequency.
Peak Hour Usage (peak_hour_analysis.sql): Analyzes hourly trends to determine peak times.
Each script contains inline comments explaining its purpose and execution.
